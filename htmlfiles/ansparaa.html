<h2 align="center"><u>Brake Failure Indicator</u></h2>
<p> This project Brake Failure Indicator gives an early warning of brake while driving. 
This circuit provides a break failure indication which verifies the condition of the brake and 
display an audio as well as a visual indication for the person at every moment.  Brake switch analyses
 the brake fluid and if the fluid level is low, the comparator activates the alarm and also gives a visual indication.

<h2 align="center"><u>Intelligent Street Light</u></h2>
<p> The  remote-control system can optimize management and efficiency of street lighting systems. 
It uses ZigBee based wireless devices which enable more efficient street lamp-system management. 
It uses a sensor combination to control and guarantee the desired system parameters; <hr/></p>
<h2 align="center"><u>Gm-APD Cameras For 3-D Imaging</u></h2>
<p>It describes cameras incorporating focal plane arrays of Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (Gm-APDs) 
that enable 3-D imaging in laser radar (LADAR) systems operating at wavelengths near 1.0 and 1.5 µm.
 Gm-APDs based on the InGaAsP material system achieve single-photon sensitivity at every pixel of the array and 
are hybridized to custom CMOS ROICs providing 0.25 ns timing resolution.
